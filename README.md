Welcome to Spend My Cents. Your life... is about to change.

For the view templates, we're using Jade (http://jade-lang.com/).
For the css, we're using Stylus (http://learnboost.github.com/stylus/). Those are in the public folder.
Routes can be found... well... in the routes folder.
I'm changing this just to change it :)
