      .question When I go to Amazon sometimes the list price is different from the price I entered. Why?
      .answer If you look around that product, you will find that one of the specific items is actually for sale at the 
        | price you entered. Amazon will not let us search on only listed price.

      .question Why is it that sometimes I see a lot of the same product?
      .answer Actually, if you look at the product on Amazon, you'll find it's slightly different. At least, it's a 
        | different product on Amazon. We have limited control over what Amazon's sending us based on your query, but

      .question So, your search bar and the buttons don't really line up that well... What gives?
      .answer We've only recently been made aware that in some cases when using Firefox, Safari (sometimes) and Internet Explorer, users have a less than ideal experience in that regard. We'll be working on a fix. For now, try using 
      a(href='http://www.google.com/chrome', target='_blank') Google Chrome 
      | :)
